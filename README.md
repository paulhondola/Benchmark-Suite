# Benchmark-Suite

This repository contains a suite of benchmarks designed to evaluate the performance of various systems and applications. The benchmarks are categorized into different types, including microbenchmarks, machine learning workloads, and SQL performance tests.

## 🎯 Objective:

Design and implement a benchmarking suite to evaluate the performance of different hardware and software configurations in executing data processing tasks. This project is intended to deepen your understanding of computer architecture, processor behavior, and system-level performance optimization.

## 🧾 Project Description:

Develop a comprehensive benchmarking toolkit that tests and compares the efficiency of multiple computing environments. This includes different CPUs (e.g., ARM vs. x86), GPUs, memory hierarchies, and relevant software frameworks. The benchmark suite will include both synthetic microbenchmarks and real-world data processing tasks.

## 🧱 Core Tasks:

### 🗂️ Benchmark Design

Develop or adapt microbenchmarks to evaluate:
Integer and floating-point throughput
Memory latency and bandwidth
Cache performance (L1/L2/L3)
Thread scalability (multi-core and hyperthreading)

### 📊 Workload Selection

Implement a selection of real-world workloads such as:
Sorting large datasets
Join operations on large tables
Machine learning inference/training (e.g., scikit-learn or TensorFlow)
Simple SQL query benchmarks using various databases

### 🖥️ Testbed Configuration

Run benchmarks across at least two different hardware configurations (e.g., laptops, Raspberry Pi, cloud VMs)
Vary software environments such as compilers (GCC vs. Clang), operating systems (Linux distros), or data processing tools (Spark, Pandas, PostgreSQL)

### 📈 Data Collection and Metrics

Record execution time, throughput, CPU/GPU utilization, and memory usage
Optionally include energy consumption metrics if supported by the system

### 🔍 Performance Analysis

Analyze benchmark results to determine performance bottlenecks
Compare and interpret differences between platforms
Discuss the trade-offs in performance vs. cost, power, or scalability

### 📦 Deliverables:

Benchmark Suite: All code and scripts, well-documented and runnable.
Written Report: Must include methodology, benchmarking results, charts/plots, and a critical discussion of findings.
Evaluation Criteria:
Technical correctness and completeness of benchmarks
Quality and reproducibility of experiments
Depth of analysis and interpretation of results
Clarity and structure of the written report
