Minor Suggestions (for future tuning, not urgent):

    FP throughput is matrix-matrix mult — excellent for CPU/GPU stress, but later consider adding scalar loops for lower-level CPU metrics (e.g., floating-point add latency).

    Memory bandwidth currently tests read+compute. To isolate read throughput, you might try:

b = a.copy()

Latency benchmark is sound. In the future, you might want to randomize access order to simulate true pointer chasing.

Cache effectiveness is beautifully done. You’re probing L1/L2/L3 edges exactly where you should.

Thread scaling now correctly distributes fixed work — you’ll finally get proper down-scaling of execution time with threads, limited only by CPU physical/logical core count and system load.
